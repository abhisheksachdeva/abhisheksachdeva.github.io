Whole world is working from home where as the people who stay at home, the housewives, for their whole life still can't find work that can be done from home.

Here, work refers to employment.

## Problem:
According to [this](https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/@asia/@ro-bangkok/@sro-new_delhi/documents/publication/wcms_324621.pdf) report from [_International Labor Organisation_](https://www.ilo.org), female participation in labor has been decreasing consistently in India since 2004-05. It went from 33.1% to 25.3% in case of rural females and 16.5% to 15.5% in case of urban females.

In the same report, it is mentioned that if given a chance, women would like to work (part-time/full-time).

### Why should women work?
In 21st century, we are still stuck at this question.

A few cents:
- Feeling of being independent, pride.
- Share family's financial responsibilities and delegate some household responsibilities to their partners. Household work isn't easy either, everyone should have an option to see both sides.
- It helps the economy.


## Why should we find a solution now?
Covid-19 has changed the way the whole world works. There are many other companies which have followed WFH even when it was not considered possible ex. Call centres.

## Difficulties
- WFH is mainly popular among tech companies. Tech companies require skillset/education. 

> How can we teach those skills with minimum resources?
Can smartphone be converted to a work device?

- What other industries can provide WFH to housewives?
- Only part-time work might be feasible for most of the housewives.

## Solution

I have nothing much to add here.

Typical solutions, that I could find on internet, are non-tech such as sewing, homemade food, consumer products.
I am looking for solutions which can leverage technology.

A few that I could think of:
- Data generation/tagging
- Voiceovers/dubbing
- Data entry (using phone?)
