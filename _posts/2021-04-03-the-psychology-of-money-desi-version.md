The psychology of Money - Desi version. JK, A few things I tried to motivate myself to invest.

## Background
I knew that investments are important but didn't have courage to do it for various reasons. Primary being, lack of knowledge and fear of losing the invested money.
So, I tried to re-define my thoughts around investing.

## Started with a question
> What returns do I expect? 10%, 15%, 100%? Nah!

My target was to beat the **savings account's Interest rate** for liquid, less volatile investments (~3%) and the **Inflation rate** for little risky/volatile/non-liquid investments (~7%)

_That's it._

I started investing mainly (like a lot of people) post lockdown during WFH. I decided that at least the amount getting saved, due to WFH, will be invested. It will be fine if I lose 100% of that which is almost impossible. 

Now, how to proceed? define these:
- Risk appetite (I used surveys available online)
- Return Expectations (like mentioned above)
- Short/Long term goals
- Lock-in/liquid
- Active/Passive investments (stocks/Mutual Funds)

These helped me narrow down my choices.

A few more points:
- IMO, start with an SIP. Don't trust your lazy self. Even if you stop investing actively, at least, you will have an SIP. SIP of 500INR will also work. 

- Start as early as possible. Understand how compunding works. Watch this video by @tanmaybhat.

I personally don't like active investments for now, so MF over Stocks. Experimented with debt MFs, ELSS, Index Funds.
Explore all of these.

Try not to regret short term missed-gains if you have already decided for long term investments. You will get plenty of chances. Don't interfere compounding. 

These pointers are only useful to get you started. After that, slowly learn and invest. Update your expectations. 

P.S I am yet to read this book xD
