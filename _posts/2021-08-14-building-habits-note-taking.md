Do you take notes?

No matter what you do, note-taking is extremely useful.

I spent 6 months just experimenting with different tools and finding the workflow & tool for myself. There are hundreds of tools and workflows available online and there is no one-fits-all. How do you choose?

### Keep in mind:
- Taking notes is like an investment, the value compounds over time if written & managed carefully and consistently.
- Workflow > Tool
- Take notes for everything.

### Steps:

- Find your type (the most important)

Graph-type: The notes you take frequently, you just keep on writing content and connect them after you write (or while writing) via links. In the end, when you have a huge collection of notes, you will be able to connect multiple topics easily like a graph, and generate ideas. Ex. [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/), [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), [logseq](logseq.com/).

Database-type: These notes are more structured, you create nested notes/folders and decide the categories beforehand. This is more useful when you want to think clearly and be organized. Ex. [Notion](notion.so/), [Evernote](evernote.com/)

Spend some time on both to understand your [type](https://youtu.be/_x54XJrECvk?t=425).

- Accessibility (and Sharing)

As a developer, I love to use terminals and care about security but there is a trade-off. Terminal-based note-taking apps can't be accessed/edited via phone easily. Terminal based: Org-mode

Notes which are secure and stored on my laptop only, are also not easily accessible. Ex. Logseq, Obsidian (unpaid)

Paper-pen notes, this is the most natural form but I do it only while brainstorming. Again, same issue.

So, prefer the tool having a phone-app and which syncs across devices. Having a browser extension and a desktop app is a huge plus. Always keep the desktop app/website open to reduce friction.

Think about accessibility like you want to access a note 1 year later or want to write a new note when you are traveling.

- Categorisation (Indexing & Search)

Hashtags are really useful when you have a huge collection of notes. Some apps provide that in-built like Google Keep but some don't like Notion.

There is a workaround in notion to do this and it works well! Make sure you use them properly for better indexing. At scale, managing notes will be hard if you don't use these properly.

Having nested folders and notebooks are very useful.

There are a few more advanced steps like reminders to recall, mini-cards to learn, highlights, etc. That is for some other day!

P.S I use notion, it has been really great.
